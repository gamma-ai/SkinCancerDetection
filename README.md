#### Category 1: ROC AUC for Melanoma Classification

In the first category, we will gauge the ability of your CNN to distinguish between malignant melanoma and the benign skin lesions (nevus, seborrheic keratosis) by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ([ROC AUC](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html)) corresponding to this binary classification task.

If you are unfamiliar with ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves and would like to learn more, you can check out the documentation in [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_roc.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-roc-py) or read [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic).

The top scores (from the ISIC competition) in this category can be found in the image below.

#### Category 2: ROC AUC for Melanocytic Classification

All of the skin lesions that we will examine are caused by abnormal growth of either [melanocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte) or [keratinocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte), which are two different types of epidermal skin cells.  Melanomas and nevi are derived from melanocytes, whereas seborrheic keratoses are derived from keratinocytes. 

In the second category, we will test the ability of your CNN to distinuish between melanocytic and keratinocytic skin lesions by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ([ROC AUC](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html)) corresponding to this binary classification task.

The top scores in this category (from the ISIC competition) can be found in the image below.

#### Category 3: Mean ROC AUC

In the third category, we will take the average of the ROC AUC values from the first two categories.

The top scores in this category (from the ISIC competition) can be found in the image below.

## Getting your Results

Once you have trained your model, create a CSV file to store your test predictions.  Your file should have exactly 600 rows, each corresponding to a different test image, **plus** a header row.  You can find an example submission file (`sample_submission.csv`) in the repository.

Your file should have exactly 3 columns:
- `Id` - the file names of the test images (in the **same** order as the sample submission file)
- `task_1` - the model's predicted probability that the image (at the path in `Id`) depicts melanoma
- `task_2` - the model's predicted probability that the image (at the path in `Id`) depicts seborrheic keratosis

Once the CSV file is obtained, you will use the `get_results.py` file to score your submission.  To set up the environment to run this file, you need to create (and activate) an environment with Python 3.5 and a few pip-installable packages:
```text
conda create --name derm-ai python=3.5
source activate derm-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have set up the environment, run the following command to see how the sample submission performed:
```text
python get_results.py sample_predictions.csv
```

Check the terminal output for the scores obtained in the three categories:
```text
Category 1 Score: 0.526
Category 2 Score: 0.606
Category 3 Score: 0.566
```

The corresponding **ROC curves** appear in a pop-up window, along with the **confusion matrix** corresponding to melanoma classification.

![Sample confusion matrix][image6]

The code for generating the confusion matrix assumes that the threshold for classifying melanoma is set to 0.5.  To change this threshold, you need only supply an additional command-line argument when calling the `get_results.py` file.  For instance, to set the threshold at 0.4, you need only run:
```text
python get_results.py sample_predictions.csv 0.4
```
